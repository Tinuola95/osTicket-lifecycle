This is the beginning of what accessing the End Users page looks like, options are to continue as a guest or login if you create tickets regularly. For this portion of the lab, I'll be creating 3 labs with varying SLA levels and problems. The one I'll be focusing on is the SEV-A case, Mail Server Disruption.

My end-user will be Katy Lee reporting on the topic of "Business Critical Outage". This automatically sets the severity on an Emergency Level when submitted.

In addition to the SEV-A ticket, I've also created lower-severity tickets focused on SEV-B.

As a level I support, I don't have the resources to deal with an issue as critical as Mail Server down. I transfer the ticket to System Administrator John Doe and notify the recipient that a fix is still being looked into. I will log into Jane's account to handle the ticket transfer

John Doe was able to find the solution "Found the issue with the Load Balancer and has reset it" and now will mark the ticket as resolved.

The ticket is now marked as resolved and within the proper SLA timeframe
