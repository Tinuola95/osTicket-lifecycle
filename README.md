This is the beginning of what accessing the End Users page looks like, options are to continue as a guest or login if you create tickets regularly. For this portion of the lab, I'll be creating 3 labs with varying SLA levels and problems. The one I'll be focusing on is the SEV-A case, Mobile Banking Disruption.

My end-user will be Ken Masters reporting on the topic of "Business Critical Outage". This automatically sets the severity on an Emergency Level when submitted.

In addition to the SEV-A ticket, I've also created lower-severity tickets focused on SEV-B.

As a level I support, I don't have the resources to deal with an issue as critical as Mobile Banking. I transfer the ticket to System Administrator Marlon Robinson and notify the recipient that a fix is still being looked into. I will log into Marlon's account to handle the ticket transfer

Marlon Robinson was able to find the solution "Found the issue with the Load Balancer and has reset it" and now will mark the ticket as resolved.
